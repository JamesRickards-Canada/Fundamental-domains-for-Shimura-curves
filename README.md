# Fundamental domains for Shimura curves

This branch is a legacy version of the code that was used to write the paper "Improved computation of fundamental domains for arithmetic Fuchsian groups" ([Link](https://doi.org/10.1090/mcom/3777) [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11503)). It should work with versions 2.13 and on, though it is no longer tested.

The default branch (klein) is greatly improved, so you should use that instead. The only real reason to use this branch is if you want to reproduce data/figures from my paper using the code that originally created them. For this, see the files paper_computations.gp, papertimetest.gp, as well as the folder data_in.
