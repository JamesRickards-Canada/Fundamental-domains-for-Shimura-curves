# Fundamental domains for Shimura curves

This package is a PARI/GP implementation of fundamental domains for Shimura curves. You can compute fundamental domains and view them with a Python application (using Matplotlib).

To use this package with GP, download fdom.gp, fdom.so, and fdviewer.py, and call "gp fdom" from the appropriate folder.

Type ?fdom to access the help

Run the file "example.gp" to see an example of these methods in action.

The files paper_computations.gp, papertimetest.gp, and the folder data_in can be used to reproduce figures from my paper, "Improved computation of fundamental domains for arithmetic Fuchsian groups".
