# Fundamental domains for congruence arithmetic Fuchsian groups.

This package is a PARI/GP implementation of fundamental domains for congruence arithmetic Fuchsian groups. Full instructions on how to download, install, and use the package can be found in the [User's Manual](Documentation/QuaternionAlgebras_PARIGP.pdf).

This code is originally based on the paper [Improved computation of fundamental domains for arithmetic Fuchsian groups](https://doi.org/10.1090/mcom/3777) ([Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11503)), which is itself based on the papers [Computing fundamental domains
for Fuchsian groups](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~jvoight/articles/funddom-jtnb-fixederrata.pdf) and [Computing arithmetic Kleinian groups](http://www.normalesup.org/~page/Recherche/Documents/articles/kln_gps.pdf).

The code in the "paper" branch matches what was used to write the paper, and data within can be recreated using this branch. This branch is no longer updated. The default branch, klein, is a significantly improved version of this code, and should be the branch of choice for 99.9% of users.
